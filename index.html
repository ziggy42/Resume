    <h1>Android</h1>
    <p>I started developing on Android platform in the late 2013.</p>
    <p>The main project that condensate all my experience on this platform is Blum. Blum is a simple, clean and fast Twitter client. It's the most complete project I've ever done.
      It uses a lot of android stuff: IntentServices, Fragments, Animation, RecyclerViews, CardViews, a lot of common used libraries (AppCompat, Picasso), multiple themes, Broadcast Receivers and a lot more.
      The app is free on Google Play but it's also open source so you can browse the code on <a href="https://github.com/ziggy42/Blum">github</a>.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Other projects I've developed for Android are also available on Github (at least the ones I've released).
      The most interesting, other than Blum, is maybe <a href="https://github.com/ziggy42/merisi">Merisi.</a></p>

    <h1>Java</h1>
    <p>I've done a lot of things in Java at my University, from basic stuff to threads, from DatagramSockets to Servlets, from jsp to hibernate.</p>
    <p>As you may expect, the most java code I've ever written was for Android, but I have solid basics of Java to use this language in a lot of scenarios without too much problems.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="fieldBlock blockLeft">
    <h1>Python</h1>
    <p>Let's start saying I love Python. I've learned the basics of this language just because a script written in Python it's beautiful to read.</p>
    <p>I've never had a chance to use it in a real project, but I use it quite often for small tasks like <a href="https://github.com/ziggy42/DCIdownloader">download the last episode of my favourite italian Radio show</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ziggy42/Pusher">use Pushbullet from the command line</a> or automate my android app testing with Monkeyrunner.</p>
    <p>I also like to solve some problems on <a href="https://www.codeeval.com/public/427ed0ee83b590abc65900bce25cb749474d0539/">Codeeval<a>, from time to time, and in the most cases I use python.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="fieldBlock blockRight">
    <h1>HTML/CSS/JS</h1>
    <p>My poor skills as a web developer are well expressed in this page.</p>
    <p>I understand the basics of html/css/js but not much more. I've studied it a little bit at my University and used them in some cases, but always small stuff.</p>
    <p>I've played with JS a little bit more cause it's used in QML too, as you'll read later.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="fieldBlock blockLeft">
    <h1>C#</h1>
    <p>I've used C# in just one University course, and developed a <a href="https://github.com/ziggy42/PusherForWindows">project with it</a>.</p>
    <p>In particular, I created a Pushbullet client as a Universal Windows App, written using C# and XAML.</p>
    <p>It's not a big project but I had a chance to play with really nice C# features such as LINQ and Lambdas.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="fieldBlock blockRight">
    <h1>QML/JS</h1>
    <p>I've developed small apps with QML for Ubuntu and Sailfish OS, but maybe the most interesting in my opinion is AirBattle.</p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/ziggy42/AirBattle-game">AirBattle</a> is a cross platform little game, that cun run with no problem on Windows, Linux, Mac, Android, iOS and so on.</p>

    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>I was born in Pordenone, Italy, on 26th of October, 1992. I went to a chemistry-oriented highschool and then moved to Trieste to study Physics at the University</p>
    <p>I've started to learn Fortran because was required in one of my courses, and I decided that programming was what I wanted to do in my life.</p>
    <p>So I moved to Bologna, and started studyng Computer Engineering</p>
    <p>I'm italian, that means I love pizza, football (Juventus) and I hate France (no that's not true üòÅ (maybe...)).</p>
